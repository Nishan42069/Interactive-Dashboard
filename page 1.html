                <h2><u>9 Key Factors to Consider When Choosing a School for Your Kids</u></h2>
                <br><h4>As a parent, your number one priority will be finding the right school for your child. Though this is a very important decision, it does not need to be a stressful one. If you just keep in mind the following considerations when choosing a school, the entire process will be truly stress-free and productive. <br><br>
                    
                    <img src="./img/12.png"><br>
                    <b>1. Location: </b>The location of the school is important while selecting the school for your child. Decide whether you want your child to attend the school from a walking distance from your home or drive your child to school or use the school's transportation system. Ideally, the closer the school, the better.<br><br>
                    <b>2. Visit Potential Schools: </b>Each parent should research the schools for their children. You can also find reliable information about schools along with their contact numbers and location at <a href="index.html">Dashboard</a>. Apart from finding information related to schools online, parents must visit the school whenever possible. During those visits, please examine the school's infrastructures like Playground, Classrooms, Bathrooms, etc., along with the pedagogical practices.<br><br>
                    <b>3. Consider the Education Quality: </b>You can not ignore the academic part while choosing the school. Compare the ranks/ GPAs etc., of that school with another school, also try to find out how their best students have performed in higher education.<br><br>
                    <b>4. Teachers Do Matter: </b>William Arthur Ward says, "The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires". The connection between the child and the teacher matters the most in learning, especially in school.<br><br>
                    <b>5. Consider the Finance: </b>Suppose 'X' School is the right fit for your child but enrolling your child in this school triggers financial complications for the whole family. As there are thousands of schools across the country, you can easily find the proper alternative which will be the best for your family and your child. Many middle-class parents hesitate to enroll their children in Governmental and Communal schools.<br><br>
                    <b>6. Consider the Infrastructure: </b>It is always a great idea to send your child to schools with excellent infrastructures. The state-of-the-art facilities like well-equipped labs, resourceful Library, well-ventilated classrooms, and playgrounds will enrich the school's academic environment and contribute to the holistic development of the Children.<br><br>
                    <b>7. Curriculum: </b>Here in Nepal, the schools offer education in different curricula of different Boards like the National Examination Board (NEB), International Baccalaureate (IB), Cambridge, CBSE, etc. Ensure what courses/subjects (both core and elective) are being taught in these programs and which curriculum will be best for you and your child.   <br><br>
                    <b>8. Apply to the Short-Listed Schools for Admission: </b>Once you select the best school(s) for your child, apply to those schools. In most of the schools, your child has to give an entrance examination for admission, and admission will be given according to the merit list. We request you to apply for more than one school because in case your child is denied to enroll in the school of the first choice, he can still opt for other schools as well. <br><br>
                    <b>9. Do Not Forget to Apply for Scholarships: </b>Almost all schools of Nepal offer attractive Scholarships to the needy and deserving students. Many of these scholarships go unclaimed every year. Reach out to the School Management, ask them if they have provisions of scholarships, and apply wherever possible. <br><br>
