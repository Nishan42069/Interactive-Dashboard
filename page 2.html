                <h4>Nepalese education, for most of history, has lagged behind in extracurricular and all-round child development. Most Nepali schools only promote rote learning and do not focus on personal character and skill development. However, that has changed in recent years with the establishment of several international standard schools that promote overall learning in children. If you are interested in an international standard of education right here in Nepal, we have compiled a list of 10 best schools.
